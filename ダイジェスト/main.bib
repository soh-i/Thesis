	Abstract = {How can the genome of Drosophila melanogaster contain fewer genes than the undoubtedly simpler organism Caenorhabditis elegans? The answer must lie within their proteomes. It is becoming clear that alternative splicing has an extremely important role in expanding protein diversity and might therefore partially underlie the apparent discrepancy between gene number and organismal complexity. Alternative splicing can generate more transcripts from a single gene than the number of genes in an entire genome. However, for the vast majority of alternative splicing events, the functional significance is unknown. Developing a full catalog of alternatively spliced transcripts and determining each of their functions will be a major challenge of the upcoming proteomic era.},

@article{Boulikas:1995rm,
	Abstract = {Protein phosphorylation has evolved as the most versatile posttranslational modification widely used by cells. Signal transduction pathways mediated by activation of MAP kinases and protein kinase C trigger the exit of cells from the quiscence (Go-->G1 transition). Indeed, binding of growth factors at the cell surface triggers their receptors, usually possessing a tyrosine kinase on the cytoplasmic side, to phosphorylate other molecules passing on the information sequentially to GRB2 protein, to p21ras, to c-Raf-1, to MAP kinase kinase, to MAP kinase, to p90rsk, to transcription factors. Activated PKC, MAP kinase, and pp90src can translocate to the nucleus where they phosphorylate a number of protein transcription regulators in a cell cycle-dependent manner or in response to cell stimulation for exit from quiescence. The cell cycle is mainly regulated by p34cdc2 or otherwise called cdc2 in association with cyclins B at G2/M and by Cdk2 in association with cyclins A, D1, and E at G1/S checkpoints; phosphorylation of histone H1 and lamins by cdc2 triggers chromosome assembly and nuclear envelope breakdown, respectively, as a prelude to mitosis. Cdc2 activities functioning as a G2/M regulator are controlled by its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation at Ser/Thr residues. MAP kinases might be the missing link in the chain connecting the Go to G1 transition with the cell cycle regulation, whereas phosphorylation of replication protein factors, retinoblastoma, and p53 might link the G1 to S transition with the control of DNA synthesis. A number of transcription factors are known to stimulate DNA replication, including p53, c-Myc, AP-1, Oct-1, T-antigen; the DNA binding activities of all these proteins and their interaction with other transcription factors are controlled by phosphorylation. The nuclear import of several proteins including NF kappa B, Dorsal, glucocorticoid receptor, ISGF3, rNFIL-6, T antigen, and the kinases PKC, MAP, and p90rsk, are dependent on their phosphorylation at specific sites. Histone phosphorylation stimulated at discrete stages of the cell cycle or in response to cAMP or other stimuli might induce profound changes in chromatin organization.},

@article{Shilatifard:2006rt,
	Abstract = {It is more evident now than ever that nucleosomes can transmit epigenetic information from one cell generation to the next. It has been demonstrated during the past decade that the posttranslational modifications of histone proteins within the chromosome impact chromatin structure, gene transcription, and epigenetic information. Multiple modifications decorate each histone tail within the nucleosome, including some amino acids that can be modified in several different ways. Covalent modifications of histone tails known thus far include acetylation, phosphorylation, sumoylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. A large body of experimental evidence compiled during the past several years has demonstrated the impact of histone acetylation on transcriptional control. Although histone modification by methylation and ubiquitination was discovered long ago, it was only recently that functional roles for these modifications in transcriptional regulation began to surface. Highlighted in this review are the recent biochemical, molecular, cellular, and physiological functions of histone methylation and ubiquitination involved in the regulation of gene expression as determined by a combination of enzymological, structural, and genetic methodologies.},

	Abstract = {Multiple sequence alignment is one of the cornerstones of modern molecular biology. It is used to identify conserved motifs, to determine protein domains, in 2D/3D structure prediction by homology and in evolutionary studies. Recently, high-throughput technologies such as genome sequencing and structural proteomics have lead to an explosion in the amount of sequence and structure information available. In response, several new multiple alignment methods have been developed that improve both the efficiency and the quality of protein alignments. Consequently, the benchmarks used to evaluate and compare these methods must also evolve. We present here the latest release of the most widely used multiple alignment benchmark, BAliBASE, which provides high quality, manually refined, reference alignments based on 3D structural superpositions. Version 3.0 of BAliBASE includes new, more challenging test cases, representing the real problems encountered when aligning large sets of complex sequences. Using a novel, semiautomatic update protocol, the number of protein families in the benchmark has been increased and representative test cases are now available that cover most of the protein fold space. The total number of proteins in BAliBASE has also been significantly increased from 1444 to 6255 sequences. In addition, full-length sequences are now provided for all test cases, which represent difficult cases for both global and local alignment programs. Finally, the BAliBASE Web site (http://www-bio3d-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/balibase) has been completely redesigned to provide a more user-friendly, interactive interface for the visualization of the BAliBASE reference alignments and the associated annotations.},

	Abstract = {Over the last decade, approximately 20-30 nucleotide RNA molecules have emerged as critical regulators in the expression and function of eukaryotic genomes. Two primary categories of these small RNAs--short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs)--act in both somatic and germline lineages in a broad range of eukaryotic species to regulate endogenous genes and to defend the genome from invasive nucleic acids. Recent advances have revealed unexpected diversity in their biogenesis pathways and the regulatory mechanisms that they access. Our understanding of siRNA- and miRNA-based regulation has direct implications for fundamental biology as well as disease etiology and treatment.},

Research during the past decade has identified major factors participating in miRNA biogenesis and has established basic principles of miRNA function. More recently, it has become apparent that miRNA regulators themselves are subject to sophisticated control. Many reports over the past few years have reported the regulation of miRNA metabolism and function by a range of mechanisms involving numerous protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Such regulation has an important role in the context-specific functions of miRNAs.},

	Abstract = {Alu exonization, which is an evolutionary pathway that creates primate-specific transcriptomic diversity, is a powerful tool for studying alternative-splicing regulation. Through bioinformatic analyses combined with experimental methodology, we identified the mutational changes needed to create functional 5' splice sites in Alu. We revealed a complex mechanism by which the sequence composition of the 5' splice site and its base pairing with the small nuclear RNA U1 govern alternative splicing. We show that in Alu-derived GC introns the strength of the base pairing between U1 snRNA and the 5' splice site controls the skipping/inclusion ratio of alternative splicing. Based on these findings, we identified 7810 Alus within the human genome that are prone to exonization. Mutations in these Alus may cause genetic disorders or contribute to human-specific protein diversity.},

(1992) Science 256, 1783-1790] and between RT and an oligonucleotide [Jacobo-Molina, A., Ding, J., Nanni, R., Clark, A. D., Lu, X., Tantillo, C., Williams, R. L., Kamer, G., Ferris, A. L., Clark, P., Hizi, A., Hughes, S. H. & Arnold, E. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 6320-6324] reveals changes associated with ligand binding. The enzyme is a heterodimer (p66/p51), with domains labeled "fingers," "thumb," "palm," and "connection" in both subunits, and a ribonuclease H domain in the larger subunit only. The most striking difference between RT and both complex structures is the change in orientation of the p66 thumb (approximately 33 degrees rotation). Smaller shifts relative to the core of the molecule were also found in other domains, including the p66 fingers and palm, which contain the polymerase active site. Within the polymerase catalytic region itself, there are no rearrangements between RT and the RT/DNA complex. In RT/Nevirapine, the drug binds in the p66 palm near the polymerase active site, a region that is well-packed hydrophobic core in the unliganded enzyme. Room for the drug is provided by movement of a small beta-sheet within the palm domain of the Nevirapine complex. The rearrangement within the palm and thumb, as well as domain shifts relative to the enzyme core, may prevent correct placement of the oligonucleotide substrate when the drug is bound.},

	Abstract = {Class II transfer RNAs (tRNAs), including tRNA(Leu) and tRNA(Ser), have an additional stem and loop structure, the long variable arm (V-arm). Here, we describe Class II tRNAs with a unique anticodon corresponding to neither leucine nor serine. Because these tRNAs are specifically conserved among the nematodes, we have called them 'nematode-specific V-arm-containing tRNAs' (nev-tRNAs). The expression of nev-tRNA genes in Caenorhabditis elegans was confirmed experimentally. A comparative sequence analysis suggested that the nev-tRNAs derived phylogenetically from tRNA(Leu). In vitro aminoacylation assays showed that nev-tRNA(Gly) and nev-tRNA(Ile) are only charged with leucine, which is inconsistent with their anticodons. Furthermore, the deletion and mutation of crucial determinants for leucylation in nev-tRNA led to a marked loss of activity. An in vitro translation analysis showed that nev-tRNA(Gly) decodes GGG as leucine instead of the universal glycine code, indicating that nev-tRNAs can be incorporated into ribosomes and participate in protein biosynthesis. Our findings provide the first example of unexpected tRNAs that do not consistently obey the general translation rules for higher eukaryotes.},

The presence of approximately two methyl groups per 1000 nucleotides of poly(A)+ RNA was calculated from the 3H/14C ratios and known degrees of methylation of 18S and 28S ribosomal RNAs. All four 2'-O-methylribonucleosides, but only two base-methylated derivatives, 7-methylguanosine (7MeG) and 6-methyladenosine (6MeA), were identified. 6MeA was the major component accounting for approximately 50% of the total methyl-labeled ribonucleosides. 7MeG, comprising about 10% of the total, was present exclusively at the 5' terminus of the poly(A)+ RNA and could be removed by periodate oxidation and beta elimination. Evidence for a 5' to 5' linkage of 7MeG to adjacent 2'-O-methylribonucleosides through at least two and probably three phosphates to give structures of the type 7MeG5'ppp5pNMep- and 7MeG5'ppp5'NMepNmep- was presented. The previous finding of similar sequences of methylated nucleotides in mRNA synthesized in vitro by enzymes associated with virus cores indicates that blocked 5' termini may be a characteristic feature of mRNAs that function in eucaryotic cells.},

	Abstract = {The 5' terminal sequences of several adenovirus 2 (Ad2) mRNAs, isolated late in infection, are complementary to sequences within the Ad2 genome which are remote from the DNA from which the main coding sequence of each mRNA is transcribed. This has been observed by forming RNA displacement loops (R loops) between Ad2 DNA and unfractionated polysomal RNA from infected cells. The 5' terminal sequences of mRNAs in R loops, variously located between positions 36 and 92, form complex secondary hybrids with single-stranded DNA from restriction endonuclease fragments containing sequences to the left of position 36 on the Ad2 genome. The structures visualized in the electron microscope show that short sequences coded at map positions 16.6, 19.6 and 26.6 on the R strand are joined to form a leader sequence of 150-200 nucleotides at the 5' end of many late mRNAs. A late mRNA which maps to the left of position 16.6 shows a different pattern of second site hybridization. It contains sequences from 4.9-6.0 linked directly to those from 9.6-10.9. These findings imply a new mechanism for the biosynthesis of Ad2 mRNA in mammalian cells.},

	Abstract = {RNA editing enhances the diversity of gene products at the post-transcriptional level. Approaches for genome-wide identification of RNA editing face two main challenges: separating true editing sites from false discoveries and accurate estimation of editing levels. We developed an approach to analyze transcriptome sequencing data (RNA-seq) for global identification of RNA editing in cells for which whole-genome sequencing data are available. We applied the method to analyze RNA-seq data of a human glioblastoma cell line, U87MG. Around 10,000 DNA-RNA differences were identified, the majority being putative A-to-I editing sites. These predicted A-to-I events were associated with a low false-discovery rate (∼5%). Moreover, the estimated editing levels from RNA-seq correlated well with those based on traditional clonal sequencing. Our results further facilitated unbiased characterization of the sequence and evolutionary features flanking predicted A-to-I editing sites and discovery of a conserved RNA structural motif that may be functionally relevant to editing. Genes with predicted A-to-I editing were significantly enriched with those known to be involved in cancer, supporting the potential importance of cancer-specific RNA editing. A similar profile of DNA-RNA differences as in U87MG was predicted for another RNA-seq data set obtained from primary breast cancer samples. Remarkably, significant overlap exists between the putative editing sites of the two transcriptomes despite their difference in cell type, cancer type, and genomic backgrounds. Our approach enabled de novo identification of the RNA editome, which sets the stage for further mechanistic studies of this important step of post-transcriptional regulation.},

	Abstract = {We identified the sequence-specific starting positions of consecutive miscalls in the mapping of reads obtained from the Illumina Genome Analyser (GA). Detailed analysis of the miscall pattern indicated that the underlying mechanism involves sequence-specific interference of the base elongation process during sequencing. The two major sequence patterns that trigger this sequence-specific error (SSE) are: (i) inverted repeats and (ii) GGC sequences. We speculate that these sequences favor dephasing by inhibiting single-base elongation, by: (i) folding single-stranded DNA and (ii) altering enzyme preference. This phenomenon is a major cause of sequence coverage variability and of the unfavorable bias observed for population-targeted methods such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq. Moreover, SSE is a potential cause of false single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls and also significantly hinders de novo assembly. This article highlights the importance of recognizing SSE and its underlying mechanisms in the hope of enhancing the potential usefulness of the Illumina sequencers.},

This provides a digital measure of the presence and prevalence of transcripts from known and previously unknown genes. We report reference measurements composed of 41-52 million mapped 25-base-pair reads for poly(A)-selected RNA from adult mouse brain, liver and skeletal muscle tissues. We used RNA standards to quantify transcript prevalence and to test the linear range of transcript detection, which spanned five orders of magnitude. Although >90% of uniquely mapped reads fell within known exons, the remaining data suggest new and revised gene models, including changed or additional promoters, exons and 3' untranscribed regions, as well as new candidate microRNA precursors. RNA splice events, which are not readily measured by standard gene expression microarray or serial analysis of gene expression methods, were detected directly by mapping splice-crossing sequence reads. We observed 1.45 x 10(5) distinct splices, and alternative splices were prominent, with 3,500 different genes expressing one or more alternate internal splices.},

	Abstract = {Ultra-high-throughput sequencing is emerging as an attractive alternative to microarrays for genotyping, analysis of methylation patterns, and identification of transcription factor binding sites. Here, we describe an application of the Illumina sequencing (formerly Solexa sequencing) platform to study mRNA expression levels. Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

Transfection of GluR-B gene constructs into PC12 cells revealed that the proximal part of the intron downstream of the unedited exonic site is required for Q/R site editing. This intron portion contains an imperfect inverted repeat preceding a 10 nt sequence with exact complementarity to the exon centered on the unedited codon. Single nucleotide substitutions in this short intronic sequence or its exonic complement curtailed Q/R site editing, which was recovered by restoring complementarity in the respective partner strand. Base conversion in the channel-coding region of GluR-B directed by base paired sequences may be executed by a ubiquitous nuclear adenosine deaminase specific for double-stranded RNA.},

	Abstract = {Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) are a family of RNA editing enzymes that convert adenosines to inosines within double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Although ADARs deaminate perfectly base-paired dsRNA promiscuously, deamination is limited to a few, selected adenosines within dsRNA containing mismatches, bulges and internal loops. As a first step in understanding how RNA structural features promote selectivity, we investigated the role of internal loops within ADAR substrates. We observed that a dsRNA helix is deaminated at the same sites whether it exists as a free molecule or is flanked by internal loops. Thus, internal loops delineate helix ends for ADAR1. Since ADAR1 deaminates short RNAs at fewer adenosines than long RNAs, loops decrease the number of deaminations within an RNA by dividing a long RNA into shorter substrates. For a series of symmetric internal loops related in sequence, larger loops (>/=six nucleotides) acted as helix ends, whereas smaller loops (</=four nucleotides) did not. Our work provides the first information about how secondary structure within ADAR substrates dictates selectivity, and suggests a rational approach for delineating minimal substrates for RNAs deaminated by ADARs in vivo.},

ADAR2 (refs 7, 8) is a candidate mammalian editing enzyme that is widely expressed in brain and other tissues, but its RNA substrates are unknown. Here we have studied ADAR2-mediated RNA editing by generating mice that are homozygous for a targeted functional null allele. Editing in ADAR2-/- mice was substantially reduced at most of 25 positions in diverse transcripts; the mutant mice became prone to seizures and died young. The impaired phenotype appeared to result entirely from a single underedited position, as it reverted to normal when both alleles for the underedited transcript were substituted with alleles encoding the edited version exonically. The critical position specifies an ion channel determinant, the Q/R site, in AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptor GluR-B pre-messenger RNA. We conclude that this transcript is the physiologically most important substrate of ADAR2.},

To examine the physiologic consequences resulting from ADAR2 misexpression, we have generated mutant mice expressing either wild-type or deaminase-deficient ADAR2 transgenes under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter. Transgenic mice expressing either wild-type or inactive ADAR2 isoforms demonstrated adult onset obesity characterized by hyperglycemia, hyperleptinemia, and increased adiposity. Paired feeding analysis revealed that mutant mice on caloric restriction had a growth rate and body composition indistinguishable from wild-type littermates, indicating that the observed obesity predominantly results from hyperphagia rather than a metabolic derangement. The observation that expression of catalytically inactive ADAR2 also is capable of producing an obese phenotype in mutant animals suggests that ADAR2 may possess additional biological activities beyond those required for the site-selective deamination of adenosine or may interfere with the actions of other double-stranded RNA-specific binding proteins in the cell.},

	Abstract = {In this report, we establish that Drosophila ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) forms a dimer on double-stranded (ds) RNA, a process essential for editing activity. The minimum region required for dimerization is the N-terminus and dsRNA-binding domain 1 (dsRBD1). Single point mutations within dsRBD1 abolish RNA-binding activity and dimer formation. These mutations and glycerol gradient analysis indicate that binding to dsRNA is important for dimerization. However, dimerization can be uncoupled from dsRNA-binding activity, as a deletion of the N-terminus (amino acids 1-46) yields a monomeric ADAR that retains the ability to bind dsRNA but is inactive in an editing assay, demonstrating that ADAR is only active as a dimer. Different isoforms of ADAR with different editing activities can form heterodimers and this can have a significant effect on editing in vitro as well as in vivo. We propose a model for ADAR dimerization whereby ADAR monomers first contact dsRNA; however, it is only when the second monomer binds and a dimer is formed that deamination occurs.},

	Abstract = {A 6,474-nucleotide human cDNA clone designated K88, which encodes double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-specific adenosine deaminase, was isolated in a screen for interferon (IFN)-regulated cDNAs. Northern (RNA) blot analysis revealed that the K88 cDNA hybridized to a single major transcript of approximately 6.7 kb in human cells which was increased about fivefold by IFN treatment. Polyclonal antisera prepared against K88 cDNA products expressed in Escherichia coli as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins recognized two proteins by Western (immunoblot) analysis. An IFN-induced 150-kDa protein and a constitutively expressed 110-kDa protein whose level was not altered by IFN treatment were detected in human amnion U and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines. Only the 150-kDa protein was detected in mouse fibroblasts with antiserum raised against the recombinant human protein; the mouse 150-kDa protein was IFN inducible. Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation analyses showed that the 110-kDa protein was exclusively nuclear, whereas the 150-kDa protein was present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of human cells. The amino acid sequence deduced from the K88 cDNA includes three copies of the highly conserved R motif commonly found in dsRNA-binding proteins. Both the 150-kDa and the 110-kDa proteins prepared from human nuclear extracts bound to double-stranded but not to single-stranded RNA affinity columns. Furthermore, E. coli-expressed GST-K88 fusion proteins that included the R motif possessed dsRNA-binding activity. Extracts prepared either from K88 cDNA-transfected cells or from IFN-treated cells contained increased dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase enzyme activity. These results establish that K88 encodes an IFN-inducible dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase and suggest that at least two forms of dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase occur in human cells.},

	Abstract = {ADAR1 and ADAR2 are editing enzymes that deaminate adenosine to inosine in long double stranded RNA duplexes and specific pre-mRNA transcripts. Here, we show that full-length and N-terminally truncated forms of ADAR1 are simultaneously expressed in HeLa and COS7 cells owing to the usage of alternative starting methionines. Because the N-terminus of ADAR1 contains a nuclear export signal, the full-length protein localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm, whereas the N-terminally truncated forms are exclusively nuclear and accumulate in the nucleolus. ADAR2, which lacks a region homologous to the N-terminal domain of ADAR1, localizes exclusively to the nucleus and similarly accumulates in the nucleolus. Within the nucleolus, ADAR1 and ADAR2 co-localize in a novel compartment. Photobleaching experiments demonstrate that, in live cells, ADAR1 and ADAR2 are in constant flux in and out of the nucleolus. When cells express the editing-competent glutamate receptor GluR-B RNA, endogenous ADAR1 and ADAR2 de-localize from the nucleolus and accumulate at sites where the substrate transcripts accumulate. This suggests that ADAR1 and ADAR2 are constantly moving through the nucleolus and might be recruited onto specific editing substrates present elsewhere in the cell.},

	Abstract = {RNA editing via the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) is catalyzed by two major families of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), ADAR1 and ADAR2. This genetic recoding process is known to play essential roles in the brain, due in part to changes in functional activities of edited neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels. Little is known, however, about the physiological regulation and function of A to I RNA editing in peripheral tissues and other biological processes. Here, we report that both ADAR1 and ADAR2 are expressed in the murine pancreatic islets, and ADAR2 is primarily localized in the islet endocrine cells. In contrast to ADAR1, ADAR2 transcripts in the pancreatic islets exhibit a nearly 2-fold increase in insulin-resistant mice chronically fed a high fat diet. Concurrent with this diet-induced metabolic stress, RNA editing in the islets is dramatically enhanced for the RNA transcripts encoding the ionotropic glutamate receptor subunit B. Moreover, ADAR2 protein expression is repressed in the islets under fuel deficiency condition during fasting, and this repression can be completely reversed by refeeding. We also show that, specifically in pancreatic beta-cell lines, not only the expression of ADAR2 but also the glutamate receptor subunit B editing and ADAR2 self-editing are markedly augmented in response to glucose at the physiological concentration for insulin secretion stimulation. Thus, RNA editing by ADAR2 in pancreatic islets and beta-cells is metabolically regulated by nutritional and energy status, suggesting that A to I RNA editing is most likely involved in the modulation of pancreatic islet and beta-cell function.},

We reported that the editing efficacy of 5-HT2CR mRNA altered during brain development in rats. The present study aimed to clarify if changes in the expression of ADAR genes and the editing of ADAR-2 pre-mRNA occur during development. The expression level of ADAR-1 mRNA was constant during development, whereas the expression levels of ADAR-2 mRNA and ADAR-2 pre-mRNA markedly increased during development. ADAR-2 pre-mRNA possesses six editing sites. Editing of these sites did not occur during the embryonic period; however, the number of edited sites and the editing frequency at these sites increased after birth and cultivation period. These results suggest that the increases in ADAR-2 pre-mRNA editing and mRNA expression of the enzyme may play a role in development. We also discuss the relationship between 5-HT2CR mRNA editing and the expression/RNA editing of ADAR-1 and ADAR-2 mRNA.},

	Abstract = {We developed a robust computational statistical framework to identify RNA editing events from RNA-Seq data with high specificity. Our approach handles several outstanding challenges of genome-wide editing analyses, including the effect of editing on read alignment and the utilization of redundant reads. By applying this framework, we characterized the nuclear and cytosolic editomes of seven human cell lines. We found that 93.8-99.2% of the editing events are A-to-G (or A-to-I). Nuclear transcriptomes contain many more editing events than cytosolic transcriptomes. Most of the sites exhibiting nucleus-specific editing are in introns or novel intergenic transcripts that are preferentially localized in the nucleus regardless of their editing status, arguing against the role of editing in nuclear retention. In contrast, many sites that exhibit cytosol-specific editing show comparable nuclear and cytosolic expression, suggesting the differential subcellular compartmentalization of the edited and the unedited alleles. We found that RNA editing is globally associated with the modification of microRNA regulation in 3' untranslated regions, whereas editing events in coding regions are rare and tend to be synonymous. Interestingly, A-to-G editing at derived alleles in the human lineage tends to result in reversion back to the ancestral forms at the RNA level. This suggests that editing can mediate RNA memory on evolutionary time-scales to maintain ancestral genetic information.},

	Abstract = {Several studies have investigated RNA-DNA differences (RDD), presumably due to RNA editing, with conflicting results. We report a rigorous analysis of RDD in exonic regions in mice, taking into account critical biases in RNA-Seq analysis. Using deep-sequenced F1 reciprocal inbred mice, we mapped 40 million RNA-Seq reads per liver sample and 180 million reads per adipose sample. We found 7300 apparent hepatic RDDs using a multiple-site mapping procedure, compared with 293 RDD found using a unique-site mapping procedure. After filtering for repeat sequence, splice junction proximity, undirectional strand, and extremity read bias, 63 RDD remained. In adipose tissue unique-site mapping identified 1667 RDD, and after applying the same four filters, 188 RDDs remained. In both tissues, the filtering procedure increased the proportion of canonical (A-to-I and C-to-U) editing events. The genomic DNA of 12 RDD sites among the potential 63 hepatic RDD was tested by Sanger sequencing, three of which proved to be due to unreferenced SNPs. We validated seven liver RDD with Sequenom technology, including two noncanonical, Gm5424 C-to-I(G) and Pisd I(G)-to-A RDD. Differences in diet, sex, or genetic background had very modest effects on RDD occurrence. Only a small number of apparent RDD sites overlapped between liver and adipose, indicating a high degree of tissue specificity. Our findings underscore the importance of properly filtering for bias in RNA-Seq investigations, including the necessity of confirming the DNA sequence to eliminate unreferenced SNPs. Based on our results, we conclude that RNA editing is likely limited to hundreds of events in exonic RNA in liver and adipose.},

We have now identified a new class of ADAR1 transcripts, with alternative 5'-structures and a deduced coding capacity for the approximately 110 kDa protein. Nuclease protection and 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5'-RACE) revealed five major ADAR1 transcriptional start sites that mapped within the previously identified and unusually large (approximately 1.6 kb) exon 2. These transcripts were observed with RNA from human amnion U cells and placenta tissue. Their abundance was not affected by IFN-alpha treatment of U cells in culture. Transfection analysis identified a functional promoter within human genomic DNA that mapped to the proximal exon 2 region of the ADAR1 gene. Promoter activity was not affected by IFN. These results suggest that transcripts encoding the constitutively expressed approximately 110 kDa form of the ADAR1 editing enzyme are initiated from multiple promoters, including one within exon 2, that collectively contribute to the high basal level of deaminase activity observed in nuclei of mammalian cells.},

We now report the molecular cloning of cDNA for RED2 (alias ADARB2), a third member of the RNA-specific adenosine deaminase family in the rodent. RED2 is closely sequence-related to RED1 but appears to be expressed only in the brain, where expression is widespread reaching highest levels in olfactory bulb and thalamus. RED2 further differs from RED1 in having a 54-residue amino-terminal extension which includes an arginine-rich motif. Different from DRADA and RED1, recombinantly expressed RED2 did not deaminate adenosines in extended synthetic dsRNA or in GluR-B pre-mRNA. However, a chimera of RED1 and RED2 edited the GluR-B Q/R and R/G sites with moderate efficiency. Our data suggest that RED2 may edit brain-specific transcripts with distinct structural features.},

Identification of more ADAR targets and genome sequences of diverse eukaryotes present an opportunity to elucidate the origin and evolution of ADAR-mediated RNA editing. Comparative analysis of the adenosine deaminase family indicates that the first ADAR might have evolved from adenosine deaminases acting on tRNAs after the split of protozoa and metazoa. ADAR1 and ADAR2 arose by gene duplications in early metazoan evolution, approximately 700 million years ago, while ADAR3 and TENR might originate after Urochordata-Vertebrata divergence. More ADAR or ADAR-like genes emerged in some animals (e.g., fish). Considering the constrained structure, ADAR targets are proposed to have evolved from transposable elements and repeats, random selection, and fixation, and intermolecular pairs of sense and antisense RNA. In some degree, increased ADAR-mediated gene regulation should substantially contribute to the emergence and evolution of complex metazoans, particularly the nervous system.},

We have isolated hADAR3, the third member of this class of human enzyme and investigated its editing site selectivity using in vitro RNA editing assay systems. As originally reported for rat ADAR3 or RED2, purified ADAR3 proteins could not edit GluR-B RNA at the "Q/R" site, the "R/G" site, and the intronic "hot spot" site. In addition, ADAR3 did not edit any of five sites discovered recently within the intracellular loop II region of 5-HT(2C)R RNAs, confirming its total lack of editing activity for currently known substrate RNAs. Filter-binding analyses revealed that ADAR3 is capable of binding not only to dsRNA but also to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). Deletion mutagenesis identified a region rich in arginine residues located in the N-terminus that is responsible for binding of ADAR3 to ssRNA. The presence of this ssRNA-binding domain as well as its expression in restricted brain regions and postmitotic neurons make ADAR3 distinct from the other two ADAR gene family members, editing competent ADAR1 and ADAR2. ADAR3 inhibited in vitro the activities of RNA editing enzymes of the ADAR gene family, raising the possibility of a regulatory role in RNA editing.},

	Abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a eukaryotic gene-silencing mechanism that functions in antiviral immunity in diverse organisms. To combat RNAi-mediated immunity, viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) that target RNA and protein components in the RNAi machinery. Although the endonuclease Dicer plays key roles in RNAi immunity, little is known about how VSRs target Dicer. Here, we show that the B2 protein from Wuhan nodavirus (WhNV), the counterpart of Flock House virus (FHV), suppresses Drosophila melanogaster RNAi by directly interacting with Dicer-2 (Dcr-2) and sequestering double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA). Further investigations reveal that WhNV B2 binds to the RNase III and Piwi-Argonaut-Zwille (PAZ) domains of Dcr-2 via its C-terminal region, thereby blocking the activities of Dcr-2 in processing dsRNA and incorporating siRNA into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Moreover, we uncover an interrelationship among diverse activities of WhNV B2, showing that RNA binding enhances the B2-Dcr-2 interaction by promoting B2 homodimerization. Taken together, our findings establish a model of suppression of Drosophila RNAi by WhNV B2 targeting both Dcr-2 and RNA and provide evidence that an interrelationship exists among diverse activities of VSRs to antagonize RNAi.},

	Abstract = {Mutagenic analysis of the substrate binding and catalytic domains of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) adenosine deaminase (DRADA) was carried out. This nuclear enzyme is likely to be involved in the RNA editing of glutamate-gated ion channels that are essential for fast excitatory neurotransmission in mammalian brain. The deletion of the first or the third of the three dsRNA binding motifs within the substrate binding domain dramatically decreases enzyme activity, whereas the second motif seems to be dispensable. The results indicate that the three motifs are not functionally equivalent in the catalytic action of DRADA. Mutation of the putative zinc-coordinating residues, His910, Cys966, and Cys1036, abolished the DRADA activity. Similarly, the Glu912 residue, predicted to be involved in the proton transfer functions of the enzyme, was found to be indispensable. Our results reinforce the previous proposal that the hydrolytic deamination mechanism of DRADA may be more similar to that of the cytidine deaminases than of adenosine deaminases.},

	Abstract = {Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) convert adenosine residues into inosines in double-stranded RNA. Three vertebrate ADAR gene family members, ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3, have been identified. The catalytic domain of all three ADAR gene family members is very similar to that of Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase and APOBEC-1. Homodimerization is essential for the enzyme activity of those cytidine deaminases. In this study, we investigated the formation of complexes between differentially epitope-tagged ADAR monomers by sequential affinity chromatography and size exclusion column chromatography. Both ADAR1 and ADAR2 form a stable enzymatically active homodimer complex, whereas ADAR3 remains as a monomeric, enzymatically inactive form. No heterodimer complex formation among different ADAR gene family members was detected. Analysis of HeLa and mouse brain nuclear extracts suggested that endogenous ADAR1 and ADAR2 both form a homodimer complex. Interestingly, endogenous ADAR3 also appears to form a homodimer complex, indicating the presence of a brain-specific mechanism for ADAR3 dimerization. Homodimer formation may be necessary for ADAR to act as active deaminases. Analysis of dimer complexes consisting of one wild-type and one mutant monomer suggests functional interactions between the two subunits during site-selective RNA editing.},

	Abstract = {Long double-stranded RNA may undergo hyper-editing by adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs), where up to 50% of adenosine residues may be converted to inosine. However, although numerous RNAs may undergo hyper-editing, the role for inosine-containing hyper-edited double-stranded RNA in cells is poorly understood. Nevertheless, editing plays a critical role in mammalian cells, as highlighted by the analysis of ADAR-null mutants. In particular, the long form of ADAR1 (ADAR1(p150)) is essential for viability. Moreover, a number of studies have implicated ADAR1(p150) in various stress pathways. We have previously shown that ADAR1(p150) localized to cytoplasmic stress granules in HeLa cells following either oxidative or interferon-induced stress. Here, we show that the Z-DNA-binding domain (Zα(ADAR1)) exclusively found in ADAR1(p150) is required for its localization to stress granules. Moreover, we show that fusion of Zα(ADAR1) to either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or polypyrimidine binding protein 4 (PTB4) also results in their localization to stress granules. We additionally show that the Zα domain from other Z-DNA-binding proteins (ZBP1, E3L) is likewise sufficient for localization to stress granules. Finally, we show that Z-RNA or Z-DNA binding is important for stress granule localization. We have thus identified a novel role for Z-DNA-binding domains in mammalian cells.},

	Abstract = {Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a common disorder that predisposes to neoplasia in tissues derived from the embryonic neural crest. The NF1 gene encodes a tumor suppressor that most likely acts through the interaction of its GTPase-activating protein (GAP)-related domain (GRD) with the product of the ras protooncogene. We have previously identified a site in the NF1 mRNA, within the first half of the NF1 GRD, which undergoes base-modification editing. Editing at that site changes a C to a U, thereby introducing an in-frame stop codon. NF1 RNA editing has been detected in all cell types studied, to date. In order to investigate the role played by editing in NF1 tumorigenesis, we analyzed RNA from 19 NF1 and 4 non-NF1 tumors. We observed varying levels of NF1 mRNA editing in different tumors, with a higher range of editing levels in more malignant tumors (e.g., neurofibrosarcomas) compared to benign tumors (cutaneous neurofibromas). Plexiform neurofibromas have an intermediate range of levels of NF1 mRNA editing. We also compared tumor and nontumor tissues from several NF1 individuals, to determine the extent of variability present in the constitutional levels of NF1 mRNA editing and to determine whether higher levels are present in tumors. The constitutional levels of NF1 mRNA editing varied slightly but were consistent with the levels observed in non-NF1 individuals. In every case, there was a greater level of NF1 mRNA editing in the tumor than in the nontumor tissue from the same patient. These results suggest that inappropriately high levels of NF1 mRNA editing does play a role in NF1 tumorigenesis and that editing may result in the functional equivalent of biallelic inactivation of the NF1 tumor suppressor.},

With the exception of yeast tRNA(Arg), no other eukaryotic tRNA substrates were found to be modified by tadA. How ever, an artificial yeast tRNA(Asp), which carries the anticodon loop of yeast tRNA(Arg), is bound and modified by tadA. Moreover, a tRNA(Arg2) minisubstrate containing the anticodon stem and loop is sufficient for specific deamination by tadA. We show that nucleotides at positions 33-36 are sufficient for inosine formation in mutant Arg2 minisubstrates. The anticodon is thus a major determinant for tadA substrate specificity. Finally, we show that tadA is an essential gene in E.coli, underscoring the critical function of inosine at the wobble position in prokaryotes.},

We report here the identification and characterization of a human ADAR protein, hADAT1, that specifically deaminates adenosine 37 to inosine in eukaryotic tRNA(Ala). It represents the functional homologue of the recently identified yeast protein Tad1p [Gerber, A., Grosjean, H., Melcher, T. & Keller, W. (1998) EMBO J. 17, 4780-4789]. The hADAT1 cDNA predicts a protein of 502 aa whose sequence displays strongest overall homology to a Drosophila melanogaster ORF (50% similarity, 32% identity), and the catalytic domain is closely related to the other ADAR proteins. In vitro, the recombinantly expressed and purified hADAT1 protein efficiently and specifically deaminates A(37) in the anticodon loop of tRNA(Ala) from higher eukaryotes and with lower efficiency from lower eukaryotes. It does not modify adenosines residing in double-stranded RNA or in pre-mRNAs that serve as substrates for ADAR1 or ADAR2. The anticodon stem-loop of tRNA(Ala) alone is not a functional substrate for hADAT1. The enzyme is expressed ubiquitously in human tissues and is represented by a single gene. The identification and cloning of hADAT1 should help to elucidate the physiological significance of this unique modification in tRNA(Ala), which is conserved from yeast to man.},

To specify the site of editing, the cis-element adjacent to the editing site functions as a binding site for the trans-acting factor. Genetic approaches using Arabidopsis thaliana have clarified that a member of the protein family with pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs is essential for RNA editing to generate a translational initiation codon of the chloroplast ndhD gene. The PPR motif is a highly degenerate unit of 35 amino acids and appears as tandem repeats in proteins that are involved in RNA maturation steps in mitochondria and plastids. The Arabidopsis genome encodes approximately 450 members of the PPR family, some of which possibly function as trans-acting factors binding the cis-elements of the RNA editing sites to facilitate access of an unidentified RNA editing enzyme. Based on this breakthrough in the research on plant RNA editing, I would like to discuss the possible steps of co-evolution of RNA editing events and PPR proteins.},

Three kinds of RNA editing were detected at 20 sites around the terminal inverted repeats (TIR); 15 A-to-G, four U-to-C, and one C-to-U conversions. A-to-G conversions are suggested to be attributed to A-to-I RNA editing on KP element RNAs, because inosine (I) in RNA is recognized as G by reverse transcriptase.

Using in vitro editing, we identified a novel editing site (F) located in the intronic part of the stem-loop and demonstrated editing at this site in human brain. We have shown that in cell culture, base substitutions to mimic editing at different combinations of the six sites profoundly affect relative splicing at the normal and the upstream alternative splice site, but splicing at the downstream alternative splice site was consistently rare. Editing combinations in different splice variants from human brain were determined and are consistent with the effects of editing on splicing observed in cell culture. As RNA editing usually occurs close to exon/intron boundaries, this is likely to be a general phenomenon and suggests an important novel role for RNA editing.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA editing is a transcript-based layer of gene regulation. To date, no systemic study on RNA editing of plant nuclear genes has been reported. Here, a transcriptome-wide search for editing sites in nuclear transcripts of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) was performed.
RESULTS: MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) and PARE (parallel analysis of RNA ends) data retrieved from public databases were utilized, focusing on one-base-conversion editing. Besides cytidine (C)-to-uridine (U) editing in mitochondrial transcripts, many nuclear transcripts were found to be diversely edited. Interestingly, a sizable portion of these nuclear genes are involved in chloroplast- or mitochondrion-related functions, and many editing events are tissue-specific. Some editing sites, such as adenosine (A)-to-U editing loci, were found to be surrounded by peculiar elements. The editing events of some nuclear transcripts are highly enriched surrounding the borders between coding sequences (CDSs) and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), suggesting site-specific editing. Furthermore, RNA editing is potentially implicated in new start or stop codon generation, and may affect alternative splicing of certain protein-coding transcripts. RNA editing in the precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs) of ath-miR854 family, resulting in secondary structure transformation, implies its potential role in microRNA (miRNA) maturation.
CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, the results provide the first global view of RNA editing in plant nuclear transcripts.},

	Abstract = {ADARs are RNA editing enzymes that target double-stranded regions of nuclear-encoded RNA and viral RNA. These enzymes are particularly abundant in the nervous system, where they diversify the information encoded in the genome, for example, by altering codons in mRNAs. The functions of ADARs in known substrates suggest that the enzymes serve to fine-tune and optimize many biological pathways, in ways that we are only starting to imagine. ADARs are also interesting in regard to the remarkable double-stranded structures of their substrates and how enzyme specificity is achieved with little regard to sequence. This review summarizes ongoing investigations of the enzyme family and their substrates, focusing on biological function as well as biochemical mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Enzymes that deaminate cytidine to uridine play an important role in a variety of pathways from bacteria to man. Ancestral members of this family were able to deaminate cytidine only in a mononucleotide or nucleoside context. Recently, a family of enzymes has been discovered with the ability to deaminate cytidines on RNA or DNA. The first member of this new family is APOBEC1, which deaminates apolipoprotein B messenger RNA to generate a premature stop codon. APOBEC1 has the conserved active site motif found in Escherichia coli cytidine deaminase. In addition, APOBEC1 has a unique motif containing 2 phenylalanine residues and an insert of 4 amino acid residues across the active site motif. This motif is present in APOBEC family members including activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), APOBEC2, and APOBEC3A through APOBEC3G. AID is essential for initiating class-switch recombination, somatic hypermutation, and gene conversion. The APOBEC3 family is unique to primates. APOBEC3G is able to protect cells from human immunodeficiency virus and other viral infections. This function is not unique to APOBEC3G; other APOBEC3 family members also have this ability. Overexpression of enzymes in this family can cause cancer, suggesting that the genes for the APOBEC family of proteins are proto-oncogenes. Recent advances in the understanding of the mechanism of action of this family are summarized in this review.},

A-->I RNA editing of protein-coding sequences of a limited number of mammalian genes results in recoding and subsequent alterations of their functions. However, A-->I RNA editing most frequently targets repetitive RNA sequences located within introns and 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). Although the biological significance of noncoding RNA editing remains largely unknown, several possibilities, including its role in the control of endogenous short interfering RNAs (esiRNAs), have been proposed. Furthermore, recent studies have revealed that the biogenesis and functions of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) are regulated by the editing of their precursors. Here, I review the recent findings that indicate new functions for A-->I editing in the regulation of noncoding RNAs and for interactions between RNA editing and RNA interference mechanisms.},

However, the transcriptome is more complex than gene expression levels alone, as alternative splicing and RNA editing generate a diverse set of mature transcripts. Here we report a high-resolution transcriptome data set of mouse cerebral cortex at embryonic and adult stages using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We found many differences in gene expression, splicing and RNA editing between embryonic and adult cerebral cortex.

	Abstract = {Next-generation massively parallel sequencing technologies provide ultrahigh throughput at two orders of magnitude lower unit cost than capillary Sanger sequencing technology. One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36x coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97% and 99.84% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

@article{Yu:2013aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) calling programs have been developed to identify Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) in next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. However, low sequencing coverage presents challenges to accurate SNV identification, especially in single-sample data. Moreover, commonly used SNP calling programs usually include several metrics in their output files for each potential SNP. These metrics are highly correlated in complex patterns, making it extremely difficult to select SNPs for further experimental validations.
RESULTS: To explore solutions to the above challenges, we compare the performance of four SNP calling algorithm, SOAPsnp, Atlas-SNP2, SAMtools, and GATK, in a low-coverage single-sample sequencing dataset. Without any post-output filtering, SOAPsnp calls more SNVs than the other programs since it has fewer internal filtering criteria. Atlas-SNP2 has stringent internal filtering criteria; thus it reports the least number of SNVs. The numbers of SNVs called by GATK and SAMtools fall between SOAPsnp and Atlas-SNP2. Moreover, we explore the values of key metrics related to SNVs' quality in each algorithm and use them as post-output filtering criteria to filter out low quality SNVs. Under different coverage cutoff values, we compare four algorithms and calculate the empirical positive calling rate and sensitivity. Our results show that: 1) the overall agreement of the four calling algorithms is low, especially in non-dbSNPs; 2) the agreement of the four algorithms is similar when using different coverage cutoffs, except that the non-dbSNPs agreement level tends to increase slightly with increasing coverage; 3) SOAPsnp, SAMtools, and GATK have a higher empirical calling rate for dbSNPs compared to non-dbSNPs; and 4) overall, GATK and Atlas-SNP2 have a relatively higher positive calling rate and sensitivity, but GATK calls more SNVs.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the agreement between different calling algorithms is relatively low. Thus, more caution should be used in choosing algorithms, setting filtering parameters, and designing validation studies. For reliable SNV calling results, we recommend that users employ more than one algorithm and use metrics related to calling quality and coverage as filtering criteria.},

However, little is known about the regulation of editing activity during development. We have developed a large-scale RNA sequencing protocol to determine adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing frequencies in the coding region of genes in the mammalian brain. Using the 454 Life Sciences (Roche) Amplicon Sequencing technology, we were able to determine even low levels of editing with high accuracy. The efficiency of editing for 28 different sites was analyzed during the development of the mouse brain from embryogenesis to adulthood. We show that, with few exceptions, the editing efficiency is low during embryogenesis, increasing gradually at different rates up to the adult mouse. The variation in editing gave receptors like HTR2C and GABA(A) (gamma-aminobutyric acid type A) a different set of protein isoforms during development from those in the adult animal. Furthermore, we show that this regulation of editing activity cannot be explained by an altered expression of the ADAR proteins but, rather, by the presence of a regulatory network that controls the editing activity during development.},

	Abstract = {Post-transcriptional modifications such as RNA editing and splicing diversify the proteome while limiting the necessary size of the genome. Although splicing globally rearranges existing information within the transcript, the conserved process of adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing recodes the message through single nucleotide changes, often at very specific locations. Because inosine is interpreted as guanosine by the cellular machineries, editing effectively results in the substitution of a guanosine for an adenosine in the primary RNA sequence. Precise control of editing is dictated by duplex structures in the transcript, formed between the exonic region surrounding the editing site and cis regulatory elements often localized in a nearby intron, suggesting that editing must precede splicing. However, the precise relationship between these post-transcriptional processes remains unclear. Here we present general commonalities of RNA editing substrates and consequential predictions regarding the interaction between editing and splicing. We also discuss anomalies and interesting cases of RNA editing that confound our understanding of the relationship between these post-transcriptional processes.},

	Abstract = {RNA editing, the post-transcriptional recoding of RNA molecules, has broad potential implications for gene expression. Several recent studies of human transcriptomes reported a high number of differences between DNA and RNA, including events not explained by any known mammalian RNA-editing mechanism. However, RNA-editing estimates differ by orders of magnitude, since technical limitations of high-throughput sequencing have been sometimes overlooked and sequencing errors have been confounded with editing sites. Here, we developed a series of computational approaches to analyze the extent of this process in the human transcriptome, identifying and addressing the major sources of error of a large-scale approach. We apply the detection pipeline to deep sequencing data from lymphoblastoid cell lines expressing ADAR1 at high levels, and show that noncanonical editing is unlikely to occur, with at least 85%-98% of candidate sites being the result of sequencing and mapping artifacts. By implementing a method to detect intronless gene duplications, we show that most noncanonical sites previously validated originate in read mismapping within these regions. Canonical A-to-G editing, on the other hand, is widespread in noncoding Alu sequences and rare in exonic and coding regions, where the validation rate also dropped. The genomic distribution of editing sites we find, together with the lack of consistency across studies or biological replicates, suggest a minor quantitative impact of this process in the overall recoding of protein sequences. We propose instead a primary role of ADAR1 protein as a defense system against elements potentially damaging to the genome.},

	Abstract = {RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process occurring in a wide range of organisms. In human brain, the A-to-I RNA editing, in which individual adenosine (A) bases in pre-mRNA are modified to yield inosine (I), is the most frequent event. Modulating gene expression, RNA editing is essential for cellular homeostasis. Indeed, its deregulation has been linked to several neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, many RNA editing sites have been identified by next generation sequencing technologies employing massive transcriptome sequencing together with whole genome or exome sequencing. While genome and transcriptome reads are not always available for single individuals, RNA-Seq data are widespread through public databases and represent a relevant source of yet unexplored RNA editing sites. In this context, we propose a simple computational strategy to identify genomic positions enriched in novel hypothetical RNA editing events by means of a new two-steps mapping procedure requiring only RNA-Seq data and no a priori knowledge of RNA editing characteristics and genomic reads. We assessed the suitability of our procedure by confirming A-to-I candidates using conventional Sanger sequencing and performing RNA-Seq as well as whole exome sequencing of human spinal cord tissue from a single individual.},

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA editing is a phenomenon, which is responsible for the alteration of particular nucleotides in RNA sequences relative to their genomic templates. Recently, a large number of RNA editing instances in humans have been identified using bioinformatic screens and high-throughput experimental investigations utilizing next-generation sequencing technologies. However, the available data on RNA editing are not uniform and difficult to access.
RESULTS: Here, we describe a new database DARNED (DAtabase of RNa EDiting) that provides centralized access to available published data related to RNA editing. RNA editing locations are mapped on the reference human genome. The current release of the database contains information on approximately 42 000 human genome coordinates corresponding to RNA locations that undergo RNA editing, mostly involving adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) substitutions. The data can be queried using a range of genomic coordinates, their corresponding functional localization in RNA molecules [Exons, Introns, CoDing Sequence (CDS) and UnTranslated Regions (UTRs)] and information regarding tissue/organ/cell sources where RNA editing has been observed. It is also possible to obtain RNA editing information for a specific gene or an RNA molecule using corresponding accession numbers. Search results provide information on the number of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) supporting edited and genomic bases, functional localization of RNA editing and existence of known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Editing data can be explored in UCSC and Ensembl genome browsers, in conjunction with additional data provided by these popular genome browsers. DARNED has been designed for researchers seeking information on RNA editing and for the developers of novel algorithms for its prediction.

	Abstract = {RNA-editing enzymes of the ADAR family convert adenosines to inosines in double-stranded RNA substrates. Frequently, editing sites are defined by base-pairing of the editing site with a complementary intronic region. The glutamate receptor subunit B (GluR-B) pre-mRNA harbors two such exonic editing sites termed Q/R and R/G. Data from ADAR knockout mice and in vitro editing assays suggest an intimate connection between editing and splicing of GluR-B pre-mRNA. By comparing the events at the Q/R and R/G sites, we can show that editing can both stimulate and repress splicing efficiency. The edited nucleotide, but not ADAR binding itself, is sufficient to exert this effect. The presence of an edited nucleotide at the R/G site reduces splicing efficiency of the adjacent intron facilitating alternative splicing events occurring downstream of the R/G site. Lack of editing inhibits splicing at the Q/R site. Editing of both the Q/R nucleotide and an intronic editing hotspot are required to allow efficient splicing. Inefficient intron removal may ensure that only properly edited mRNAs become spliced and exported to the cytoplasm.},

	Abstract = {The carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol II) is essential for several co-transcriptional pre-messenger RNA processing events, including capping, 3'-end processing and splicing. We investigated the role of the CTD of RNA pol II in the coordination of A to I editing and splicing of the ADAR2 (ADAR: adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) pre-mRNA. The auto-editing of Adar2 intron 4 by the ADAR2 adenosine deaminase is tightly coupled to splicing, as the modification of the dinucleotide AA to AI creates a new 3' splice site. Unlike other introns, the CTD is not required for efficient splicing of intron 4 at either the normal 3' splice site or the alternative site created by editing. However, the CTD is required for efficient co-transcriptional auto-editing of ADAR2 intron 4. Our results implicate the CTD in site-selective RNA editing by ADAR2 and in coordination of editing with alternative splicing.},

	Abstract = {RNA editing by adenosine deaminases acting on RNAs (ADARs) can be both specific and non-specific, depending on the substrate. Specific editing of particular adenosines may depend on the overall sequence and structural context. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying these preferences are not fully understood. Here, we show that duplex structures mimicking an editing site in the Gabra3 pre-mRNA unexpectedly fail to support RNA editing at the Gabra3 I/M site, although phylogenetic analysis suggest an evolutionarily conserved duplex structure essential for efficient RNA editing. These unusual results led us to revisit the structural requirement for this editing by mutagenesis analysis. In vivo nuclear injection experiments of mutated editing substrates demonstrate that a non-conserved structure is a determinant for editing. This structure contains bulges either on the same or the strand opposing the edited adenosine. The position of these bulges and the distance to the edited base regulate editing. Moreover, elevated folding temperature can lead to a switch in RNA editing suggesting an RNA structural change. Our results indicate the importance of RNA tertiary structure in determining RNA editing.},

Genetic recoding by editing was so far observed for only a few mammalian RNAs that are predominantly expressed in nervous tissues. However, as these editing targets fail to explain the broad and severe phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice, additional targets for editing by ADARs were always expected. Using comparative genomics and expressed sequence analysis, we identified and experimentally verified four additional candidate human substrates for ADAR-mediated editing: FLNA, BLCAP, CYFIP2 and IGFBP7. Additionally, editing of three of these substrates was verified in the mouse while two of them were validated in chicken. Interestingly, none of these substrates encodes a receptor protein but two of them are strongly expressed in the CNS and seem important for proper nervous system function. The editing pattern observed suggests that some of the affected proteins might have altered physiological properties leaving the possibility that they can be related to the phenotypes of ADAR1 knockout mice.},

Although this is an important function of ADARs, especially in the nervous system, editing in coding sequences is rare compared to editing in noncoding sequences. Introns and untranslated regions of mRNA are the primary noncoding targets, but editing also occurs in small RNAs, such as miRNAs.

	Abstract = {Nucleotide deamination is a widespread phenomenon frequently leading to a change of the genetic information. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosines to inosines in double-stranded or structured regions of RNAs. Inosines are interpreted as guanosines by most cellular processes and hence, this type of modification can affect the coding potential of an RNA but also its splicing, folding or stability, to name a few. While originally believed to be a rare event recent bioinformatic screens have demonstrated that RNA editing by ADARs is widespread and very abundant in mammals. From these screens, editing sites were discovered in both coding and non-coding regions of mRNAs. In this review we focus on RNA editing events that alter the coding potential of mRNAs and hence lead to the formation of proteins that differ from their genomically encoded versions. We will therefore discuss the role of ADARs in proteome diversification, in particular in the nervous system where editing is most abundant.},

	Abstract = {The term "RNA editing" encompasses a wide variety of mechanistically and phylogenetically unrelated processes that change the nucleotide sequence of an RNA species relative to that of the encoding DNA. Two general classes of editing, substitution and insertion/deletion, have been described, with all major types of cellular RNA (messenger, ribosomal, and transfer) undergoing editing in different organisms. In cases where RNA editing is required for function (e.g., to generate a translatable open reading frame in a mRNA), editing is an obligatory step in the pathway of genetic information expression. How, when, and why individual RNA editing systems originated are intriguing biochemical and evolutionary questions. Here I review briefly what is known about the biochemistry, genetics, and phylogenetics of several very different RNA editing systems, emphasizing what we can deduce about their origin and evolution from the molecular machinery involved. An evolutionary model, centered on the concept of "constructive neutral evolution", is able to account in a general way for the origin of RNA editing systems. The model posits that the biochemical elements of an RNA editing system must be in place before there is an actual need for editing, and that RNA editing systems are inherently mutagenic because they allow potentially deleterious or lethal mutations to persist at the genome level, whereas they would otherwise be purged by purifying selection.},

	Abstract = {Changes in neural activity influence synaptic plasticity/scaling, gene expression, and epigenetic modifications. We present the first evidence that short-term and persistent changes in neural activity can alter adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, a post-transcriptional site-specific modification found in several neuron-specific transcripts. In rat cortical neuron cultures, activity-dependent changes in A-to-I RNA editing in coding exons are present after 6 hr of high potassium depolarization but not after 1 hr and require calcium entry into neurons. When treatments are extended from hours to days, we observe a negative feedback phenomenon: Chronic depolarization increases editing at many sites and chronic silencing decreases editing. We present several different modulations of neural activity that change the expression of different mRNA isoforms through editing.},

	Abstract = {RNA editing by adenosine deamination is a process used to diversify the proteome. The expression of ADARs, the editing enzymes, is ubiquitous among true metazoans, and so adenosine deamination is thought to be universal. By changing codons at the level of mRNA, protein function can be altered, perhaps in response to physiological demand. Although the number of editing sites identified in recent years has been rising exponentially, their effects on protein function, in general, are less well understood. This review assesses the state of the field and highlights particular cases where the biophysical alterations and functional effects caused by RNA editing have been studied in detail.},

Inosines are interpreted as guanosines and hence, this type of editing can change codons, alter splice patterns, or influence the fate of an RNA. A to I editing is most abundant in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, targets for this type of nucleotide modification frequently encode receptors and channels. In many cases, the editing-induced amino acid exchanges alter the properties of the receptors and channels. Consistently, changes in editing patterns are frequently found associated with diseases of the CNS. In this review we describe the mechanisms of RNA editing and focus on target mRNAs of editing that are functionally relevant to normal and aberrant CNS activity.},

@article{Blow:2004aa,
	Abstract = {We have conducted a survey of RNA editing in human brain by comparing sequences of clones from a human brain cDNA library to the reference human genome sequence and to genomic DNA from the same individual. In the RNA sample from which the library was constructed, approximately 1:2000 nucleotides were edited out of >3 Mb surveyed. All edits were adenosine to inosine (A-->I) and were predominantly in intronic and in intergenic RNAs. No edits were found in translated exons and few in untranslated exons. Most edits were in high-copy-number repeats, usually Alus. Analysis of the genome in the vicinity of edited sequences strongly supports the idea that formation of intramolecular double-stranded RNA with an inverted copy underlies most A-->I editing. The likelihood of editing is increased by the presence of two inverted copies of a sequence within the same intron, proximity of the two sequences to each other (preferably within 2 kb), and by a high density of inverted copies in the vicinity. Editing exhibits sequence preferences and is less likely at an adenosine 3' to a guanosine and more likely at an adenosine 5' to a guanosine. Simulation by BLAST alignment of the double-stranded RNA molecules that underlie known edits indicates that there is a greater likelihood of A-->I editing at A:C mismatches than editing at other mismatches or at A:U matches. However, because A:U matches in double-stranded RNA are more common than all mismatches, overall the likely effect of editing is to increase the number of mismatches in double-stranded RNA.},

A reasonable assumption would be that the underlying adaptations lie within the encoding genes. Here, we show that delayed rectifier K(+) channel genes from an Antarctic and a tropical octopus encode channels that differ at only four positions and display very similar behavior when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. However, the transcribed messenger RNAs are extensively edited, creating functional diversity. One editing site, which recodes an isoleucine to a valine in the channel's pore, greatly accelerates gating kinetics by destabilizing the open state. This site is extensively edited in both Antarctic and Arctic species, but mostly unedited in tropical species. Thus adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing can respond to the physical environment.},

	Abstract = {Since Hodgkin and Huxley discovered the potassium current that underlies the falling phase of action potentials in the squid giant axon, the diversity of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels has been manifested in multiple ways. The large and extended potassium channel family is evolutionarily conserved molecularly and functionally. Alternative splicing and RNA editing of Kv channel genes diversify the channel property and expression level. The mix-and-match of subunits in a Kv channel that contains four similar or identical pore-forming subunits and additional auxiliary subunits further diversify Kv channels. Moreover, targeting of different Kv channels to specific subcellular compartments and local translation of Kv channel mRNA in neuronal processes diversify axonal and dendritic action potentials and influence how synaptic plasticity may be modulated. As one indication of the evolutionary conservation of Kv1 channel functions, mutations of the Shaker potassium channel gene in Drosophila and the KCNA1 gene for its mammalian orthologue, Kv1.1, cause hyperexcitability near axon branch points and nerve terminals, thereby leading to uncontrolled movements and recapitulating the episodic ataxia-1 (EA1) symptoms in human patients.},

@article{Watanabe:2008aa,
	Abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism by which double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) suppress specific transcripts in a sequence-dependent manner. dsRNAs are processed by Dicer to 21-24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and then incorporated into the argonaute (Ago) proteins. Gene regulation by endogenous siRNAs has been observed only in organisms possessing RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). In mammals, where no RdRP activity has been found, biogenesis and function of endogenous siRNAs remain largely unknown. Here we show, using mouse oocytes, that endogenous siRNAs are derived from naturally occurring dsRNAs and have roles in the regulation of gene expression. By means of deep sequencing, we identify a large number of both approximately 25-27-nucleotide Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and approximately 21-nucleotide siRNAs corresponding to messenger RNAs or retrotransposons in growing oocytes. piRNAs are bound to Mili and have a role in the regulation of retrotransposons. siRNAs are exclusively mapped to retrotransposons or other genomic regions that produce transcripts capable of forming dsRNA structures. Inverted repeat structures, bidirectional transcription and antisense transcripts from various loci are sources of the dsRNAs. Some precursor transcripts of siRNAs are derived from expressed pseudogenes, indicating that one role of pseudogenes is to adjust the level of the founding source mRNA through RNAi. Loss of Dicer or Ago2 results in decreased levels of siRNAs and increased levels of retrotransposon and protein-coding transcripts complementary to the siRNAs. Thus, the RNAi pathway regulates both protein-coding transcripts and retrotransposons in mouse oocytes. Our results reveal a role for endogenous siRNAs in mammalian oocytes and show that organisms lacking RdRP activity can produce functional endogenous siRNAs from naturally occurring dsRNAs.},

	Abstract = {RNA-seq data can be mined for sequence differences relative to the reference genome to identify both genomic SNPs and RNA editing events. We analyzed the long, polyA-selected, unstranded, deeply sequenced RNA-seq data from the ENCODE Project across 14 human cell lines for candidate RNA editing events. On average, 43% of the RNA sequencing variants that are not in dbSNP and are within gene boundaries are A-to-G(I) RNA editing candidates. The vast majority of A-to-G(I) edits are located in introns and 3' UTRs, with only 123 located in protein-coding sequence. In contrast, the majority of non-A-to-G variants (60%-80%) map near exon boundaries and have the characteristics of splice-mapping artifacts. After filtering out all candidates with evidence of private genomic variation using genome resequencing or ChIP-seq data, we find that up to 85% of the high-confidence RNA variants are A-to-G(I) editing candidates. Genes with A-to-G(I) edits are enriched in Gene Ontology terms involving cell division, viral defense, and translation. The distribution and character of the remaining non-A-to-G variants closely resemble known SNPs. We find no reproducible A-to-G(I) edits that result in nonsynonymous substitutions in all three lymphoblastoid cell lines in our study, unlike RNA editing in the brain. Given that only a fraction of sites are reproducibly edited in multiple cell lines and that we find a stronger association of editing and specific genes suggests that the editing of the transcript is more important than the editing of any individual site.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alu retroelements are specific to primates and abundant in the human genome. Through mutations that create functional splice sites within intronic Alus, these elements can become new exons in a process denoted exonization. It was recently shown that Alu elements are also heavily changed by RNA editing in the human genome.
RESULTS: Here we show that the human nuclear prelamin A recognition factor contains a primate-specific Alu-exon that exclusively depends on RNA editing for its exonization. We demonstrate that RNA editing regulates the exonization in a tissue-dependent manner, through both the creation of a functional AG 3' splice site, and alteration of functional exonic splicing enhancers within the exon. Furthermore, a premature stop codon within the Alu-exon is eliminated by an exceptionally efficient RNA editing event. The sequence surrounding this editing site is important not only for editing of that site but also for editing in other neighboring sites as well.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that the abundant RNA editing of Alu sequences can be recruited as a mechanism supporting the birth of new exons in the human genome.},

Repressive heterochromatin is established through the RNA interference pathway, triggered by double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that can be modified via RNA editing. However, the biological consequences of such modifications remain enigmatic. Here we show that RNA editing regulates heterochromatic gene silencing in Drosophila. We utilize the binding activity of an RNA-editing enzyme to visualize the in vivo production of a long dsRNA trigger mediated by Hoppel transposable elements. Using homologous recombination, we delete this trigger, dramatically altering heterochromatic gene silencing and chromatin architecture. Furthermore, we show that the trigger RNA is edited and that dADAR serves as a key regulator of chromatin state. Additionally, dADAR auto-editing generates a natural suppressor of gene silencing. Lastly, systemic differences in RNA editing activity generates interindividual variation in silencing state within a population.

This editing is carried out by the family of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins. The most-studied substrates of ADAR proteins undergo editing which is very consistent, highly conserved, and functionally important. However, editing causes changes in protein-coding regions only at a small proportion of all editing sites. The vast majority of editing sites are in noncoding sequences.

	Abstract = {The main type of RNA editing in mammals is the conversion of adenosine to inosine which is translated as if it were guanosine. The enzymes that catalyze this reaction are ADARs (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA), of which there are four in mammals, two of which are catalytically inactive. ADARs edit transcripts that encode proteins expressed mainly in the CNS and editing is crucial to maintain a correctly functioning nervous system. However, the majority of editing has been found in transcripts encoding Alu repeat elements and the biological role of this editing remains a mystery. This chapter describes in detail the different ADAR enzymes and the phenotype of animals that are deficient in their activity. Besides being enzymes, ADARs are also double-stranded RNA-binding proteins, so by binding alone they can interfere with other processes such as RNA interference. Lack of editing by ADARs has been implicated in disorders such as forebrain ischemia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and this will also be discussed.},

	Abstract = {ADAR (adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA) editing enzymes target coding and noncoding double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and are essential for neuronal function. Early studies showed that ADARs preferentially target adenosines with certain 5' and 3' neighbours. Here we use current Sanger sequencing protocols to perform a more accurate and quantitative analysis. We quantified editing sites in an ∼800-bp dsRNA after reaction with human ADAR1 or ADAR2, or their catalytic domains alone. These large data sets revealed that neighbour preferences are mostly dictated by the catalytic domain, but ADAR2's dsRNA-binding motifs contribute to 3' neighbour preferences. For all proteins, the 5' nearest neighbour was most influential, but adjacent bases also affected editing site choice. We developed algorithms to predict editing sites in dsRNA of any sequence, and provide a web-based application. The predictive power of the algorithm on fully base-paired dsRNA, compared with biological substrates containing mismatches, bulges and loops, elucidates structural contributions to editing specificity.},

	Abstract = {The role of epigenetics in tumor onset and progression has been extensively addressed. Discoveries in the last decade completely changed our view on RNA. We now realize that its diversity lies at the base of biological complexity. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing emerges a central generator of transcriptome diversity and regulation in higher eukaryotes. It is the posttranscriptional deamination of adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA catalyzed by enzymes of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family. Thought at first to be restricted to coding regions of only a few genes, recent bioinformatic analyses fueled by high-throughput sequencing revealed that it is a widespread modification affecting mostly non-coding repetitive elements in thousands of genes. The rise in scope is accompanied by discovery of a growing repertoire of functions based on differential decoding of inosine by the various cellular machineries: when recognized as guanosine, it can lead to protein recoding, alternative splicing or altered microRNA specificity; when recognized by inosine-binding proteins, it can result in nuclear retention of the transcript or its degradation. An imbalance in expression of ADAR enzymes with consequent editing dysregulation is a characteristic of human cancers. These alterations may be responsible for activating proto-oncogenes or inactivating tumor suppressors. While unlikely to be an early initiating 'hit', editing dysregulation seems to contribute to tumor progression and thus should be considered a 'driver mutation'. In this review, we examine the contribution of A-to-I RNA editing to carcinogenesis.},

@article{Carmi:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Adenosine-to-inosine modification of RNA molecules (A-to-I RNA editing) is an important mechanism that increases transciptome diversity. It occurs when a genomically encoded adenosine (A) is converted to an inosine (I) by ADAR proteins. Sequencing reactions read inosine as guanosine (G); therefore, current methods to detect A-to-I editing sites align RNA sequences to their corresponding DNA regions and identify A-to-G mismatches. However, such methods perform poorly on RNAs that underwent extensive editing ("ultra"-editing), as the large number of mismatches obscures the genomic origin of these RNAs. Therefore, only a few anecdotal ultra-edited RNAs have been discovered so far. Here we introduce and apply a novel computational method to identify ultra-edited RNAs. We detected 760 ESTs containing 15,646 editing sites (more than 20 sites per EST, on average), of which 13,668 are novel. Ultra-edited RNAs exhibit the known sequence motif of ADARs and tend to localize in sense strand Alu elements. Compared to sites of mild editing, ultra-editing occurs primarily in Alu-rich regions, where potential base pairing with neighboring, inverted Alus creates particularly long double-stranded RNA structures. Ultra-editing sites are underrepresented in old Alu subfamilies, tend to be non-conserved, and avoid exons, suggesting that ultra-editing is usually deleterious. A possible biological function of ultra-editing could be mediated by non-canonical splicing and cleavage of the RNA near the editing sites.},

While editing in small RNAs was rare, at least 40% of microRNAs had altered levels in at least one ADAR mutant strain, and miRNAs with significantly altered levels had mRNA targets with correspondingly affected levels. About 40% of siRNAs derived from endogenous genes (endo-siRNAs) also had altered levels in at least one mutant strain, including 63% of Dicer-dependent endo-siRNAs. The 26G class of endo-siRNAs was significantly affected by ADARs, and many altered 26G loci had intronic reads and histone modifications associated with transcriptional silencing.

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT: Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional process by which adenosines are selectively converted to inosines in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates. A highly conserved group of enzymes, the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) family, mediates this reaction. All ADARs share a common domain architecture consisting of a variable number of amino-terminal dsRNA binding domains (dsRBDs) and a carboxy-terminal catalytic deaminase domain. ADAR family members are highly expressed in the metazoan nervous system, where these enzymes predominantly localize to the neuronal nucleus. Once in the nucleus, ADARs participate in the modification of specific adenosines in pre-mRNAs of proteins involved in electrical and chemical neurotransmission, including pre-synaptic release machineries, and voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels. Most RNA editing sites in these nervous system targets result in non-synonymous codon changes in functionally important, usually conserved, residues and RNA editing deficiencies in various model organisms bear out a crucial role for ADARs in nervous system function. Mutation or deletion of ADAR genes results in striking phenotypes, including seizure episodes, extreme uncoordination, and neurodegeneration. Not only does the process of RNA editing alter important nervous system peptides, but ADARs also regulate gene expression through modification of dsRNA substrates that enter the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway and may then act at the chromatin level. Here, we present a review on the current knowledge regarding the ADAR protein family, including evolutionary history, key structural features, localization, function and mechanism.},

	Abstract = {Adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is the most abundant editing event in animals. It converts adenosine to inosine in double-stranded RNA regions through the action of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins. Editing of pre-mRNA coding regions can alter the protein codon and increase functional diversity. However, most of the A-to-I editing sites occur in the non-coding regions of pre-mRNA or mRNA and non-coding RNAs. Untranslated regions (UTRs) and introns are located in pre-mRNA non-coding regions, thus A-to-I editing can influence gene expression by nuclear retention, degradation, alternative splicing, and translation regulation. Non-coding RNAs such as microRNA (miRNA), small interfering RNA (siRNA) and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) are related to pre-mRNA splicing, translation, and gene regulation. A-to-I editing could therefore affect the stability, biogenesis, and target recognition of non-coding RNAs. Finally, it may influence the function of non-coding RNAs, resulting in regulation of gene expression. This review focuses on the function of ADAR-mediated RNA editing on mRNA non-coding regions (UTRs and introns) and non-coding RNAs (miRNA, siRNA, and lncRNA).},

This suggests a pool of common RNA substrates capable of engaging both pathways. To define and characterize such substrates, we examined small RNA and mRNA populations of ADAR mutants and identified a distinct set of loci from which RNAi-dependent short RNAs are markedly upregulated. At these same loci, we observed populations of multiply edited transcripts, supporting a specific role for ADARs in preventing access to the RNAi pathway for an extensive population of dsRNAs. Characterization of these loci revealed a substantial overlap with noncoding and intergenic regions, suggesting that the landscape of ADAR targets may extend beyond previously annotated classes of transcripts.},

	Abstract = {Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is a post-transcriptional, site-specific modification process that is catalyzed by Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR) gene family members. Since ADARs act on double-stranded RNA, most A-to-I editing occurs within repetitive elements, particularly Alu elements, as the result of the inherent property of these sequences to fold and form double strands. ADAR1-mediated A-to-I RNA editing was recently implicated in the regulation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Spontaneous and neuronal differentiation of hESC was shown to result in a decrease in A-to-I editing levels. Knockdown of ADAR1 in hESCs results in an elevation of the expression of differentiation-related genes. In addition, we found that hESCs over-expressing ADAR1 could not be generated. The current study shows that the editing levels of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) change throughout reprogramming, from a source cell level to a level similar to that of hESCs. Up- or down-regulation of the ADAR1 level in human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells before induction of reprogramming results in varied reprogramming efficiencies. Furthermore, HFF-iPSC early clones derived from source cells in which the ADAR1 level was down-regulated lose their iPSC properties shortly after iPSC colony formation and instead exhibit characteristics of cancer cells. Taken together, our results imply a role for ADAR1 in the regulation of pluripotency induction as well as in the maintenance of early iPSC properties.},

There are a large number of edited sites within nascent exons. Nascent RNA from an ADAR-null strain was also sequenced, indicating that almost all A-to-I events require ADAR. Moreover, mRNA editing levels correlate with editing levels within the cognate nascent RNA sequence, indicating that the extent of editing is set cotranscriptionally. Surprisingly, the nascent data also identify an excess of intronic over exonic editing sites. These intronic sites occur preferentially within introns that are poorly spliced cotranscriptionally, suggesting a link between editing and splicing. We conclude that ADAR-mediated editing is more widespread than previously indicated and largely occurs cotranscriptionally.},

	Abstract = {RNA molecules transmit the information encoded in the genome and generally reflect its content. Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing by ADAR proteins converts a genomically encoded adenosine into inosine. It is known that most RNA editing in human takes place in the primate-specific Alu sequences, but the extent of this phenomenon and its effect on transcriptome diversity is not yet clear. Here, we analyzed large-scale RNA-seq data and detected over 1.6 million editing sites. As detection sensitivity increases with sequencing coverage, we performed ultra-deep sequencing of selected Alu sequences and showed that the scope of editing is much larger than anticipated. We found that virtually all adenosines within Alu repeats that form double-stranded RNA undergo A-to-I editing, although most sites exhibit editing at only low levels (<1%). Moreover, using high coverage sequencing, we observed editing of transcripts resulting from residual anti-sense expression, doubling the number of edited sites in the human genome. Based on bioinformatic analyses and deep targeted sequencing, we estimate that there are over 100 million human Alu RNA editing sites, located in the majority of human genes. These findings set the stage for exploring how this primate-specific massive diversification of the transcriptome is utilized.},

@article{Zhu:2013aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing is recognized as a cellular mechanism for generating both RNA and protein diversity. Inosine base pairs with cytidine during reverse transcription and therefore appears as guanosine during sequencing of cDNA. Current approaches of RNA editing identification largely depend on the comparison between transcriptomes and genomic DNA (gDNA) sequencing datasets from the same individuals, and it has been challenging to identify editing candidates from transcriptomes in the absence of gDNA information.
RESULTS: We have developed a new strategy to accurately predict constitutive RNA editing sites from publicly available human RNA-seq datasets in the absence of relevant genomic sequences. Our approach establishes new parameters to increase the ability to map mismatches and to minimize sequencing/mapping errors and unreported genome variations. We identified 695 novel constitutive A-to-I editing sites that appear in clusters (named "editing boxes") in multiple samples and which exhibit spatial and dynamic regulation across human tissues. Some of these editing boxes are enriched in non-repetitive regions lacking inverted repeat structures and contain an extremely high conversion frequency of As to Is. We validated a number of editing boxes in multiple human cell lines and confirmed that ADAR1 is responsible for the observed promiscuous editing events in non-repetitive regions, further expanding our knowledge of the catalytic substrate of A-to-I RNA editing by ADAR enzymes.
CONCLUSIONS: The approach we present here provides a novel way of identifying A-to-I RNA editing events by analyzing only RNA-seq datasets. This method has allowed us to gain new insights into RNA editing and should also aid in the identification of more constitutive A-to-I editing sites from additional transcriptomes.},

Here, we present a discovery pipeline in adult Drosophila, with 3,581 high-confidence editing sites identified with an estimated accuracy of 87%. The target genes and specific sites highlight global biological properties and functions of RNA editing, including hitherto-unknown editing in well-characterized classes of noncoding RNAs and 645 sites that cause amino acid substitutions, usually at conserved positions. The spectrum of functions that these gene targets encompass suggests that editing participates in a diverse set of cellular processes. Editing sites in Drosophila exhibit sequence-motif preferences and tend to be concentrated within a small subset of total RNAs. Finally, editing regulates expression levels of target mRNAs and strongly correlates with alternative splicing.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: ADAR proteins are among the most extensively studied RNA binding proteins. They bind to their target and deaminate specific adenosines to inosines. ADAR activity is essential, and the editing of a subset of their targets is critical for viability. Recently, a huge number of novel ADAR targets were detected by analyzing next generation sequencing data. Most of these novel editing sites are located in lineage-specific genomic repeats, probably a result of overactivity of editing enzymes, thus masking the functional sites. In this study we aim to identify the set of mammalian conserved ADAR targets.
RESULTS: We used RNA sequencing data from human, mouse, rat, cow, opossum, and platypus to define the conserved mammalian set of ADAR targets. We found that the conserved mammalian editing sites are surprisingly small in number and have unique characteristics that distinguish them from non-conserved ones. The sites that constitute the set have a distinct genomic distribution, tend to be located in genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors or other synapse related proteins, and have higher editing and expression levels. We also found a high consistency of editing levels of this set within mice strains and between human and mouse. Tight regulation of editing in these sites across strains and species implies their functional importance.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the discovery of numerous editing targets, only a small number of them are conserved within mammalian evolution. These sites are extremely highly conserved and exhibit unique features, such as tight regulation, and probably play a pivotal role in mammalian biology.},

	Abstract = {High-throughput sequencing platforms are generating massive amounts of genetic variation data for diverse genomes, but it remains a challenge to pinpoint a small subset of functionally important variants. To fill these unmet needs, we developed the ANNOVAR tool to annotate single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions/deletions, such as examining their functional consequence on genes, inferring cytogenetic bands, reporting functional importance scores, finding variants in conserved regions, or identifying variants reported in the 1000 Genomes Project and dbSNP. ANNOVAR can utilize annotation databases from the UCSC Genome Browser or any annotation data set conforming to Generic Feature Format version 3 (GFF3). We also illustrate a 'variants reduction' protocol on 4.7 million SNVs and indels from a human genome, including two causal mutations for Miller syndrome, a rare recessive disease. Through a stepwise procedure, we excluded variants that are unlikely to be causal, and identified 20 candidate genes including the causal gene. Using a desktop computer, ANNOVAR requires ∼4 min to perform gene-based annotation and ∼15 min to perform variants reduction on 4.7 million variants, making it practical to handle hundreds of human genomes in a day.

@article{Chen:2012aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The genomic information which is transcribed into the primary RNA can be altered by RNA editing at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, which provides an effective way to create transcript diversity in an organism. Altering can occur through substitutional RNA editing or via the insertion or deletion of nucleotides relative to the original template. Taking advantage of recent high throughput sequencing technology combined with bioinformatics tools, several groups have recently studied the genome-wide substitutional RNA editing profiles in human. However, while insertional/deletional (indel) RNA editing is well known in several lower species, only very scarce evidence supports the existence of insertional editing events in higher organisms such as human, and no previous work has specifically focused on indel differences between RNA and their matching DNA in human. Here, we provide the first study to examine the possibility of genome-wide indel RNA-DNA differences in one human individual, NA12878, whose RNA and matching genome have been deeply sequenced.
RESULTS: We apply different computational tools that are capable of identifying indel differences between RNA reads and the matching reference genome and we initially find hundreds of such indel candidates. However, with careful further analysis and filtering, we conclude that all candidates are false-positives created by splice junctions, paralog sequences, diploid alleles, and known genomic indel variations.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our study suggests that indel RNA editing events are unlikely to exist broadly in the human transcriptome and emphasizes the necessity of a robust computational filter pipeline to obtain high confidence RNA-DNA difference results when analyzing high throughput sequencing data as suggested in the recent genome-wide RNA editing studies.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is a site-selective post-transcriptional alteration of double-stranded RNA by ADAR deaminases that is crucial for homeostasis and development. Recently the Mouse Genomes Project generated genome sequences for 17 laboratory mouse strains and rich catalogues of variants. We also generated RNA-seq data from whole brain RNA from 15 of the sequenced strains.
RESULTS: Here we present a computational approach that takes an initial set of transcriptome/genome mismatch sites and filters these calls taking into account systematic biases in alignment, single nucleotide variant calling, and sequencing depth to identify RNA editing sites with high accuracy. We applied this approach to our panel of mouse strain transcriptomes identifying 7,389 editing sites with an estimated false-discovery rate of between 2.9 and 10.5%. The overwhelming majority of these edits were of the A-to-I type, with less than 2.4% not of this class, and only three of these edits could not be explained as alignment artifacts. We validated 24 novel RNA editing sites in coding sequence, including two non-synonymous edits in the Cacna1d gene that fell into the IQ domain portion of the Cav1.2 voltage-gated calcium channel, indicating a potential role for editing in the generation of transcript diversity.
CONCLUSIONS: We show that despite over two million years of evolutionary divergence, the sites edited and the level of editing at each site is remarkably consistent across the 15 strains. In the Cds2 gene we find evidence for RNA editing acting to preserve the ancestral transcript sequence despite genomic sequence divergence.},

	Abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals. However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed, many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools, many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

	Abstract = {SUMMARY: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAMtools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments.

@article{Slotkin:2013aa,
	Abstract = {A-to-I RNA editing is a post-transcriptional modification that converts adenosines to inosines in both coding and noncoding RNA transcripts. It is catalyzed by ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) enzymes, which exist throughout the body but are most prevalent in the central nervous system. Inosines exhibit properties that are most similar to those of guanosines. As a result, ADAR-mediated editing can post-transcriptionally alter codons, introduce or remove splice sites, or affect the base pairing of the RNA molecule with itself or with other RNAs. A-to-I editing is a mechanism that regulates and diversifies the transcriptome, but the full biological significance of ADARs is not understood. ADARs are highly conserved across vertebrates and are essential for normal development in mammals. Aberrant ADAR activity has been associated with a wide range of human diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, metabolic diseases, viral infections and autoimmune disorders. ADARs have been shown to contribute to disease pathologies by editing of glutamate receptors, editing of serotonin receptors, mutations in ADAR genes, and by other mechanisms, including recently identified regulatory roles in microRNA processing. Advances in research into many of these diseases may depend on an improved understanding of the biological functions of ADARs. Here, we review recent studies investigating connections between ADAR-mediated RNA editing and human diseases.},

@article{Sleep:2013aa,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Next (second) generation sequencing is an increasingly important tool for many areas of molecular biology, however, care must be taken when interpreting its output. Even a low error rate can cause a large number of errors due to the high number of nucleotides being sequenced. Identifying sequencing errors from true biological variants is a challenging task. For organisms without a reference genome this difficulty is even more challenging.
RESULTS: We have developed a method for the correction of sequencing errors in data from the Illumina Solexa sequencing platforms. It does not require a reference genome and is of relevance for microRNA studies, unsequenced genomes, variant detection in ultra-deep sequencing and even for RNA-Seq studies of organisms with sequenced genomes where RNA editing is being considered.
CONCLUSIONS: The derived error model is novel in that it allows different error probabilities for each position along the read, in conjunction with different error rates depending on the particular nucleotides involved in the substitution, and does not force these effects to behave in a multiplicative manner. The model provides error rates which capture the complex effects and interactions of the three main known causes of sequencing error associated with the Illumina platforms.},

@article{Sakurai:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Inosine is an abundant RNA modification in the human transcriptome and is essential for many biological processes by modulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze the hydrolytic deamination of adenosines to inosines (A-to-I editing) in double-stranded regions. We previously established a biochemical method called 'inosine chemical erasing (ICE)' to directly identify inosines on RNA strands with high reliability. Here, we have applied the ICE-method combined with deep sequencing (ICE-seq) to conduct an unbiased genome-wide screening of A-to-I editing sites in the transcriptome of human adult brain. Taken together with the sites identified by conventional ICE-method, we mapped 19,791 novel sites and newly found 1,258 edited mRNAs, including 66 novel sites in coding regions, 41 of which cause altered amino acid assignment. ICE-seq detected novel editing sites in various repeat elements as well as in short hairpins. Gene ontology analysis revealed that these edited mRNAs are associated with transcription, energy metabolism and neurological disorders, providing new insights into various aspects of human brain function.},
